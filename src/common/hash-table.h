 *
 * @brief Murphy hash table implementation.
 *
 * Murphy hash tables provide a simple, general hash table implementation.
 * The API provides the usual functions for creating, destroying, and
 * resetting hash tables. It provides functions for adding entries, deleting
 * entries and looking up entries to and from hash tables. Additionally,
 * macros and functions are provided for iterating through all entries in a
 * hash table.
 *
 * One potentially interesting feature of Murphy hash tables is the optional
 * cookie support. You can think of hash table cookies as hints to speed up
 * insertion, lookup, deletion and replacement operations of hash table
 * entries. In the best case, the achievable efficiency is O(1). Cookies can
 * be viewed as virtual- or pseudo-indices into the hash table. When cookies
 * are used properly, the hash table effectively becomes a table which is both
 * indexable by hash keys and by pseudo-indices, IOW cookies.
 *
 * The easiest way to use cookies is to let the table allocate cookies for
 * you. However, if you prefer to do so you can provide cookies for the table
 * yourself. If you chose to do so, some case must be taken to properly select
 * cookies such, that the table is able to utilize them to speed up access.
 *
 * Generally speaking, to make sure cookies do achieve O(1) access times, you
 * either need to let the table allocate cookies for you, or you need to
 * declare how many entries the table is going to have at max and use as
 * cookies unique integers between 1 and the maximum number of table entries.
